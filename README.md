# Moufette

The fast & visual way for your users to communicate with you, give them a voice so they can help you build and decide when to **persevere** or **pivot**!

## How does it work?

Moufette is built of 2 parts:
1. A fully customizable embedable JS widget, to collect user feedback with screenshots, also allows your users to vote on upcomoing features
2. Dashboard to control the widget, custumize it and review feedbacks and votes.

## Philosophy

Many engineers struggle to get the critical early feedback they need to help them navigate the product development and prioritize a long list of features. Moufette is here to solve that.

Moufette is **not** an analytics tool replacement but rather a complementary. It's important to understand how users behave on your website but in many cases you can't make any sense of their random clicks and scrolling. So why not just ask them! People love to tell what they think or even criticise especially if they think you're wrong ([Cunningham's Law](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Cunningham%27s_Law)). And this is exactly what you need at this stage.
